The Human Obstacle Detection and Tracking software is a perception stack for robots to navigate robustly around humans. The robots are equipped with a monocular camera with the help of which it identifies and tracks humans. This enables the robot to be around humans in a safe manner. 

The code in this repository was contributed by Kashif Ansari, Abhishek Avadh and Piyush Goenka, all of which are pursuing their M.Eng. in Robotics degree from the University of Maryland. This repository was developed for the Mid-term project of the  course ENPM700: Software Development for Robotics. 

The software uses an RGB camera attached to the robot as input. The use of YOLO and OpenCV enables the processing of the image. The below screenshot conveys the output of the software.

### Dependencies

This project uses the OpenCV C++ library for computer vision tasks. Our system also uses a YOLO object detection model. This model helps us 

### Download and Build the workspace
```bash
# Download the code:
  git clone https://github.com/kashifansaricodes/Human-Obstacle-Detector-and-Tracker
  cd Human-Obstacle-Detector-and-Tracker

# Configure the project and generate a native build system:
  # Must re-run this command whenever any CMakeLists.txt file has been changed.
  cmake -S ./ -B build/

# Compile and build the project:
  # rebuild only files that are modified since the last build
  cmake --build build/
  # or rebuild everything from scracth
  cmake --build build/ --clean-first
  # to see verbose output, do:
  cmake --build build/ --verbose

# Build docs:
  cmake --build build/ --target docs
  # open a web browser to browse the doc
  open docs/html/index.html
```

### Run the code 

```bash
# Run program:
  ./build/app/shell-app

# Run tests:
  cd build/; ctest; cd -
  # or if you have newer cmake
  ctest --test-dir build/
```
